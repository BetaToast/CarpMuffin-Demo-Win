# CarpMuffin
A Game Engine written in Monogame and C#

Base engine code is up, but more work is coming for demo's and documentation.





######The project uses git submodules to link in other projects.  We also use GitFlow process (which is basicly me saying most of the code is currently in develop)
to get the project to work just clone the develop branch, and init and update the submodules.
example.  

*git clone -b develop https://github.com/BetaToast/CarpMuffin-Demo-Win.git --recursive

*git pull --recurse-submodules
